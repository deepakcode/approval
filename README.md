Time Entry Approval Flow Design Document
1. Introduction
This document outlines the design of a scalable and efficient time entry approval system using Spring Boot microservices. The system allows time entries to be approved or rejected at a granular level, based on a selected time window.
2. Approval Flow
2.1 Workflow
Explicit Submit Flow Enabled


Pending â†’ Submit â†’ Approve/Reject


If rejected:


Worker can edit and resubmit.


Approver can edit and approve.


Explicit Submit Flow Disabled


Pending â†’ Approve/Reject


No submission step required.

             |                        |                      |
             |                        -->Reject--> [Rejected] (Resubmit/Edit)
             -->Approve--> [Approved]

3. Architecture
3.1 Microservices Involved
Time Entry Service - Manages time entries.


Approval Service - Handles approval flow and state transitions.


User Service - Manages employee and approver roles.


Notification Service - Sends notifications upon state transitions.


3.2 Communication Mechanism
REST APIs for synchronous interactions.


Kafka for asynchronous approval/rejection events.


Redis for caching frequent queries.


4. Database Schema Design

ENUM
Pending, Approved, Rejected

Approval Table

5. API Design
5.1 Time Entry Service APIs
Submit Time Entry: POST /time-entries/{id}/submit


Get Time Entry: GET /time-entries/{id}


List Worker Time Entries: GET /time-entries?workerId={workerId}


5.2 Approval Service APIs
Approve Time Entry: POST /approvals/{id}/approve


Reject Time Entry: POST /approvals/{id}/reject


Edit & Approve: PUT /approvals/{id}/edit


Bulk Approve/Reject for Employees in Time Window: POST /approvals/bulk


Request Body:

 {
  "workerIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2"],
  "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "action": "approve/reject",
  "reason": "Optional rejection reason"
}


Description: Approves or rejects time entries for a list of employees within a specified time window.


6. Scalability Considerations
Batch Processing: Bulk approval for multiple employees.


Caching Layer: Redis caching for frequently accessed time entries.


Asynchronous Handling: Kafka for event-driven state transitions.


Sharding Strategy: Distribute time entries across database partitions.


7. Implementation Plan
7.1 Phase 1: Core Services Implementation
Implement Time Entry Service: CRUD operations for time entries.


Implement Approval Service: Approval/rejection workflow and state transitions.


Implement User Service: User and role management.


Implement Notification Service: Notify users of status changes.


7.2 Phase 2: Advanced Features
Implement Kafka-based event handling for approval status changes.


Add Redis caching for quick retrieval of time entries.


Optimize batch processing for bulk approvals.


7.3 Phase 3: UI and Final Enhancements
Develop Front-end UI for time entry submission and approval.


Add GraphQL support for flexible data queries.


Conduct performance tuning and stress testing.



The next step will be implementing the detailed Java code for this system.





8. Should You Use a Spring Boot State Machine?
Spring Boot State Machine (SSM) is useful when you need to manage complex state transitions, such as workflows involving multiple stages and conditional approvals. Below is a comparison of using SSM versus the existing implementation.

Pros of Using Spring Boot State Machine
Clear State Transitions:


SSM provides a declarative way to define state transitions, making it easier to visualize and manage the approval workflow.


Better Maintainability:


The workflow logic is separate from business logic, making changes easier without affecting core approval processing.


Support for Advanced Workflows:


If approvals need multi-step verification (e.g., first-level manager approval â†’ HR approval â†’ finance approval), SSM can handle hierarchical approvals.


Event-Driven & Asynchronous Processing:


SSM supports event-driven execution, which can improve performance in a highly concurrent environment.


Built-in Features:


Provides hooks for audit logging, retries, and dynamic transitions.



Cons of Using Spring Boot State Machine
Overhead for Simple Workflows:


Your current implementation is straightforward (PENDING â†’ APPROVED/REJECTED). Adding SSM may introduce unnecessary complexity.


Increased Learning Curve:


Developers need to understand and manage state transitions, event handling, and listeners, increasing onboarding time.


More Configuration and Maintenance:


Requires additional setup and configuration, including defining states, events, and transitions in XML or Java.


Potential Performance Overhead:


If not optimized, SSM can add latency compared to direct database updates.



Comparison with the Current Implementation
Feature
Existing Implementation
Spring Boot State Machine
Performance
Direct DB updates, optimized batch operations
Event-driven, could add slight overhead
Maintainability
Simple, easy to update logic
Requires defining states & transitions
Scalability
Efficient batch processing
Event-based, scales well but needs tuning
Complexity
Straightforward logic
More configuration required
Use Case Fit
Best for simple approval flows
Best for multi-step approvals


Conclusion
If your approval process remains simple (Pending â†’ Approved/Rejected), stick with the current implementation for performance and maintainability.
 If you expect multi-step approvals or dynamic workflow changes, consider integrating Spring Boot State Machine.
